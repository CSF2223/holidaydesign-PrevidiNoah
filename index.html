                Speaking of witches, the Italian version of Santa Claus is an ugly (but kind) old witch called La Befana. As the story goes, the Magi stopped at her house to ask for directions on their way to visit baby Jesus. They invited Befana to come with them on their journey, but she said she had too much housework to do. After they left, she changed her mind and tried to find them but couldn’t, so now she flies around on the night of January 5 (the eve of the Epiphany, which marks the Magi’s meeting with Baby Jesus). Much like Santa, La Befana delivers toys to children. Instead of milk and cookies, Italians leave out a plate of sausage and broccoli and a glass of wine for her.

            KFC for Christmas (Japan)
        </h3>

In the United States, we associate Christmas with ham or figgy pudding, but in Japan, it’s all about Kentucky Fried Chicken. An estimated 3.5 million Japanese families eat fried chicken on Christmas Eve thanks to a marketing stunt by KFC in the 1970s called Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakkii (“Kentucky for Christmas”). Christians make up a very small percentage of the Japanese population, so this campaign made up for a lack of Christmas holiday traditions. The KFC Christmas Meal is so popular, many customers pre-order their dinners — which include fried chicken, cake and champagne — months in advance.
